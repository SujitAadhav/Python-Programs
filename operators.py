# Operators in Python
# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# a = 5
# b = 6
# print("a + b is ", a + b)
# print("a - b is ", a - b)
# print("a / b is ", a / b)
# print("a * b is ", a * b)
# print("a % b is ", a % b)
# print("a // b is ", 15 // 6)
# print("a ** b is ", a ** b)

# Assignment Operators
# print("Assignment Operators")
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x % = 7   # x = x % 7

# Comparison Operators
# print(5==5)
# print(5!=5)
# print(5>4)
# print(5<4)


# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a and a)
#
# print(a | a)
# print(a | b)


# Identity Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is not b)
# print(a is b)
#
# print(a is a)
# print(a is not a)


# Membership Operators
# list = [4, 54, 54, 43, 3, 4, 5,6, 75, 4]
# print(34345 not in list)
# print(54 in list)
# print(32 in list)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11

print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3)
